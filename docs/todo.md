- this tool is nice-ish for now
- features
    - refactoring
        - needs to follow simple data flow, draw it out! manual scaffolding! full understanding of flow before involvement of ai.
        - no more old shit and compatibility stuff.
    - features
        - syntax highlighting
            - irrelevant nodes given current selected ndoe (50% bright)
            - remaining nodes that are currently not actionable (75% bright)
            - actionable nodes (shimmer)
        - write functionality!
            - edit tasks using UI (inspector like UI?)
        - plan feature
            - in graph: plan node, links up different tasks and execute on it
        - commands
            - goto command (specialized)
            - cli passthrough with tab completion
            - perhaps expose this as a virtual environment of a REAL shell (very insecure.. better alternatives to unify UI and commands? OH! actually just importing the cli lib..)
        - structural
            - better way to model nested UI keyboard shortcuts etc, reconfigurable like vscode would be amazing
        - backend mcp
        - better view interpolation
        - better graph plotting:
            - right now relationships arent super clear, and the radial nature is a bit disorienting. 
            - webcola plotting.
